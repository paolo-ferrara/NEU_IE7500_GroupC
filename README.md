## Project Decription

This project is designed to develop a medical chatbot that predicts potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms and recommends suitable medical assistance. By integrating reliable datasets and telemedicine APIs, it bridges that gap between symptoms analysis and healthcare access. 

The project addresses the growing need for accessible healthcare solutions, particularly in scenarios where professional medical assistance is not immediately available.

## Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a medical chatbot that allows users to provide or select a list of symptoms and receive possible disease predictions along with recommendations for appropriate medical assistance. Additionally, that chatbot may connect users with telemedicine platforms using APIs to recommend physicians or specialists in the relevant field.  

This project is highly relevant to NLP because it involves understanding and interpreting user-provided natural languages symptom descriptions, matching them with structured medical data and delivering meaningful insights in a conversational manner.
